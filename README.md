# covid_india

This dataset includes time series data tracking the number of people affected by COVID-19 in India

The dataset includes

Number of  Confirmed cases of Covid19 for each State/UT
Number of  Death cases of Covid19 for each State/UT
Number of  Recovered cases of Covid19 for each State/UT

## Data

Data for this project is sourced from Ministry of Health and Family welfare website
Link:- https://www.mohfw.gov.in/

Table given in the website updates regularly however there is no date/time series column.
I've added a Date column that returns today's date and save each days data as "mm-dd-yyyy.csv" format(eg:- 04-17-2020.csv"

Then I combine each days data into a single csv.

This data will be updated every day.
